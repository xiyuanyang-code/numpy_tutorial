# Learning Numpy within 30 minutes!

ðŸ˜ŠQuickly get started with basic NumPy operations in 30 minutes!

See https://xiyuanyang-code.github.io/posts/Python-numpy-cheatsheet/ for more details.

## Introduction

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more. [^1]

This repo provides with the basic numpy tutorial with `.ipynb` file, aiming to teach greenhands to quickly get started with basic NumPy operations using Jupyter Notebook interaction in 30 minutes.

## Installation


This command is for importing the numpy module in your python scripts:
```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4
```

You can also use the `requirements.txt` file in this repo.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After the installation, run the first code cell in `numpy_tutorial.ipynb` to check if the output is correct. (`1.26.4`)

## Usage

The tutorial includes several parts:

- Creating arrays and matrix
- Checking parameters of Arrays
- Accessing and modifying elements
	- Slices
	- Modifications
- Repetition, Copying and Reshaping
	- Repeat
	- Copy
	- Reshape
- Linear Algebra and other mathematical operations
	- Basic Mathematical operations
	- Linear Algebra
- Statics
	- Boolean Mask
- Advanced Usage
	- Loading data from files

Go to the juypter notebook for more details!

## In the future...

We will finish the `/demo` directory in the future, which will provides you with practical applications of numpy.
